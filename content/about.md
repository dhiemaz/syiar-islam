I am an Indonesian Muslim blogger. I hold a Master in Information Technology and on going in pursue B.A. in Islamic Studies (IOU) and also Phd in Computer Science.

The Catatan (seorang) Muslim is not in reference to any particular person, rather, it is an attribute and a quality of an individual. It is a Muslim who not only thinks deeply about his/her own faith but also about the society in which he/she lives.

I started this blog to share things which I find interesting and fascinating about Islam and life in general, which I hope will lead to a stronger spiritual, intellectual, and social development for myself and my readers. I hope the readers find the articles and resources on this blog just as intriguing as I found them while penning them down.

One of my other goals through this blog is to help spread Islam to the English speaking world. All of it is free to use and benefit from!

JazakAllah Khair
