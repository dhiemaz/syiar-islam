During Ramadan, Muslims are required to fast during the day. Apart from fasting, they are encouraged to do a lot of good, especially sharing in the glorious month of Ramadan. Many hadiths explain the virtue of sharing in Ramadan.

A history mentions the Prophet's answer regarding the virtue of sharing or alms in the month of Ramadan. Charity in the month of Ramadan has extraordinary features as reported by Anas bin Malik RA:

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">عَنْ اَنَسٍ قِيْلَ يَارَسُولَ اللهِ اَيُّ الصَّدَقَةِ اَفْضَلُ؟ قَالَ: صَدَقَةٌ فِى رَمَضَانَ</p>

_"From Anas it was said, 'O Messenger of Allah, what alms are of the highest value?' The Prophet (Peace be upon him) replied, 'Alms in the month of Ramadan,'"_ (HR At-Tirmidhi).

The friends also witnessed the generosity of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) in Ramadan compared to other months. They witnessed the Prophet (Peace be upon him) share more often in the month of Ramadan as narrated by Bukhari and Muslim as follows:

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">كَانَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ أَجْوَدَ النَّاسِ وَكَانَ أَجْوَدُ (أَجْوَدَ) مَا يَكُونُ فِي رَمَضَانَ</p>

_"The Prophet (ﷺ) is the most generous person among other humans, and he is more generous when he is in the month of Ramadan,"_ (HR Bukhari and Muslim).

From here, the scholars draw the conclusion that Islam motivates its followers to share, especially in the month of Ramadan and especially in the last 10 days.

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">ويسن الإكثار من الصدقة في رمضان لا سيما في عشره الأواخر</p>

_"[A person] is encouraged to share more in the month of Ramadan, especially in the last 10 days,"_ (See Syekh M Nawawi Banten, Nihayatuz Zain, [Bandung, Syirkah Al-Maarif: undated], page 183).

Al-Baijuri explained the virtue of sharing in the month of Ramadan. Rewards for sharing in the month of Ramadan can be multiplied compared to rewards for sharing in other months.

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">ومبادرته لإكثار الصدقة لأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان أجود ما يكون في رمضان، وبالجملة فيكثر فيه من أعمال الخير لأن العمل يضاعف فيه على العمل في غيره من بقية الشهور</p>

_“(The fasting person) is advised to immediately increase alms because Rasulullah SAW is the most generous person in the month of Ramadan. One can do good in general because the reward for good deeds in any form will be multiplied compared to the rewards for good deeds done outside the month of Ramadan, "_ (See Syekh Ibrahim Al-Baijuri, Hasyiyatul Baijuri, [Beirut, Darul Pole Al-Ilmiyyah: 1999 M/1420 H], second printing, juz I, page 562).
