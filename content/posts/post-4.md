In these economic times, many agree that the situation is indeed not easy. For some people, conditions have worsened and do not seem to be improving. 

In such circumstances, there is a hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that should become our guide in life. 

This hadith should be pondered and observed amidst difficult times, abnormal conditions, heavy situations, or times filled with trials and problems.

**When Do Tests and Allah’s Help Come?**

From Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (ﷺ) said,

_"Indeed, assistance comes from Allah to a servant in proportion to their level of difficulty or need. And indeed, patience comes from Allah in proportion to the level of calamity."_
(Narrated by Al-Bazzar in Al-Musnad, 15:327; Al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman, 12:337. Authenticated by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’ no. 1952)

In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) explains that help will be sent by Allah to us according to our level of need or the crisis (problems and difficulties) we are facing.

In another narration, the Prophet (ﷺ) said,

_"Allah the Exalted sends assistance in proportion to the level of difficulty or need, and He sends patience when faced with calamities."_ 
(Narrated by Al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman, 12:337)

If the problem we are facing could be converted into a number, then Allah's assistance would come at that level. If the problem we face is at 70%, then Allah will send help at 70%, not less than that. 

Therefore, when we encounter trials and tests, we must remember and believe that tests and help from Allah run parallel in a straight line. Trials (calamities) will not leave help behind. Allah is the One who gives us trials, just as He is the One who provides us with assistance.

But the issue is, where is our faith in this hadith? Where is our belief? Because this hadith is only for those who believe in Allah the Exalted and His Messenger (peace be upon him). This hadith is only for those who believe in their Lord.

From Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (ﷺ) said,

_"Allah the Exalted says: 'I am as My servant thinks of Me. If he thinks good of Me, he will have it, and if he thinks bad of Me, he will have it.'"_ 
(Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad no. 9076; authenticated by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’ no. 4315)

If we believe that Allah’s help will come, then Allah will send help. And if we think badly of Allah, if we are pessimistic in facing trials, then more problems will come, and there will be no solution at all.

**Asking for Help and Reliance on Allah**

Help will be sent by Allah in proportion to the level of difficulty faced by a servant. But who among us rushes towards Allah, asking for His help when facing trials? 

Instead, we are busy going to person A, person B, person C, and so on. We turn to all directions except towards Allah the Exalted. Who among us, when facing a problem, 

immediately remembers Allah, the Lord of the worlds? Who among us, when faced with a problem, immediately performs ablution and prays because of remembering the words of Allah the Exalted,

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">وَاسۡتَعِيۡنُوۡا بِالصَّبۡرِ وَالصَّلٰوةِ ​ؕ وَاِنَّهَا لَكَبِيۡرَةٌ اِلَّا عَلَى الۡخٰشِعِيۡنَۙ‏</p>

_"Seek help with patience and prayer; indeed, it is difficult except for the humble-minded."_ (Q.S, Al-Baqarah: 45)

Unfortunately, many of us depend more on people when facing these times. The proof is that there is no increase in our devotion in prayer, 

no additional units in our night prayers, and where are our tears of repentance to Allah the Exalted? Where are our pleas for forgiveness to Allah?

Help descends from Allah, the Lord of the universe. Life is full of tests, like earthquakes in our lives. This is the life of believers; trials and calamities come one after another. 

This is as Allah Ta'ala says,

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">اَمۡ حَسِبۡتُمۡ اَنۡ تَدۡخُلُوا الۡجَـنَّةَ وَ لَمَّا يَاۡتِكُمۡ مَّثَلُ الَّذِيۡنَ خَلَوۡا مِنۡ قَبۡلِكُمۡؕ مَسَّتۡهُمُ الۡبَاۡسَآءُ وَالضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلۡزِلُوۡا حَتّٰى يَقُوۡلَ الرَّسُوۡلُ وَالَّذِيۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡا مَعَهٗ مَتٰى نَصۡرُ اللّٰهِؕ اَلَاۤ اِنَّ نَصۡرَ اللّٰهِ قَرِيۡبٌ‏</p>

_"Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said, 
'When is the help of Allah?' Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near."_ (Q.S, Al-Baqarah: 214)

The help of Allah is near, but we are in a hurry and do not want to be patient. We do not increase our worship but want to get out of problems immediately. 

There are no tears of repentance, but we want a solution immediately. In other words, we want to succeed immediately, but we do not want to go through and tread the path of success, just as a boat does not sail on land. Allah the Exalted says,

_"So take a lesson, O people of vision."_ (Q.S, Al-Hashr: 2)

As an alim (scholar) advised,

_"Fear Allah, be patient, and do not be hasty."_
