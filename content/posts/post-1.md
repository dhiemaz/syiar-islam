The keys to sustenance are twofold: natural causes and religious causes. Natural causes are related to the law of cause and effect, for example, the key to sustenance in this context includes trading, farming, and working. Religious causes, on the other hand, are determined by Sharia, explaining why something happens, even if it is not a natural cause.

Here are the religious causes of sustenance found in the Qur'an:

**Taqwa (Piety)**

Allah Ta'ala says:

وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ

_"And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect."_ [1]

**Tawakkul (Trust in Allah)**

Allah Ta'ala says:

وَمَنْ يَّتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللّٰهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهٗ

_"And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him."_ [2]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:

لَوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنْتُمْ تَوَكَّلُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ حَقَّ تَوَكُّلِهِ لَرُزِقْتُمْ كَمَا تُرْزَقُ الطَّيْرُ تَغْدُو خِمَاصًا وَتَرُوحُ بِطَانًا

_"If you were to rely upon Allah with reliance due to Him, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds. They go out in the morning with empty stomachs and return in the evening with full stomachs."_ [3]

**Salat (Prayer)**

Allah Ta'ala says:

وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا ۖ لَا نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقًا ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ ۗ وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ

_"And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provide for you. And the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness."_ [4]

**Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness)**

Allah Ta'ala says:

فَقُلْتُ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّاراً . يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاء عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَاراً . وَيُمْدِدْكُمْ بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ أَنْهَاراً

_"I (Prophet Noah) said (to them), 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers and give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.'"_ [5]

**Infaq (Spending in the Way of Allah)**

Allah Ta'ala says:

وَمَا أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ ۖ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ

_"And whatever you spend of anything [in Allah's cause], He will replace it; and He is the best of providers."_ [6]

In a Hadith Qudsi, Allah Ta'ala says:

أَنْفِقْ يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ، أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْكَ

_"Spend (in charity), O son of Adam, and I shall spend on you."_ [7]

Ibn Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "What is meant by infaq here is the spending that is recommended in religion. Like spending on the poor and spending in the cause of Allah to support the religion." [8]
