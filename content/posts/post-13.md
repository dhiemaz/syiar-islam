### Obligations of a Person Blessed with Knowledge

It is obligatory for a person whom Allah has blessed with the sustenance of knowledge to be honest in advising the community, whether as a group or individually. They should guide them towards the paths of goodness according to the knowledge they possess and warn them of the paths of evil and discord within their capacity.

A person should never be deterred from advising Muslims due to the criticisms of others. If asked about a scholar (worthy of teaching), a teacher, a student, a school, a specialty, a branch of knowledge, a book, a treatise, an article, a choice between two equally strong opinions, two scholars who should be prioritized, or the most beneficial of two lessons, they should advise and direct according to what they know to be best and most beneficial for the inquirer.

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said:

**وَعَلَى العَالِمِ أَنْ يَنْصَحَ لِلْمُتَعَلِّمِ وَيَجْتَهِدَ فِيْ تَعْلِيْمِهِ، وَعَلَى المُتَعَلِّمِ أَنْ يَعْرِفَ حُرْمَةَ أُسْتَاذِهِ وَيَشْكُرَ إِحْسَانِهِ إِلَيْهِ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ لَا يَشْكُرُ النَّاسَ لَا يَشْكُر اللهَ**

_"A knowledgeable person should advise their students and strive to teach them. A student should recognize the status of their teacher and be grateful for their kindness. Indeed, those who do not show gratitude to people do not show gratitude to Allah."_ [1]

If a teacher is unsure about the correctness of an opinion, they must withhold judgment. Otherwise, they may fall into the category of those who speak about Allah without knowledge.

If a teacher directs an inquirer towards something less beneficial and advantageous, merely to gain worldly benefits, seek praise, or flatter those in positions of authority, they are not truly advising as per the path of the Prophets, 'alaihimussalam.

### Statements of the Prophets Regarding Advice

As Prophet Noah 'alaihis-salam said:

**أُبَلِّغُكُمۡ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ رَبِّى وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمۡ**

_"I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you sincerely."_ (Q.S Al-A'raf: 62)

Prophet Hud 'alaihis-salam said:

**أُبَلِّغُكُمۡ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ رَبِّى وَأَنَا۟ لَكُمۡ نَاصِحٌ أَمِينٌ**

_"I convey to you the messages of my Lord and I am to you a trustworthy advisor."_ (Q.S Al-A'raf: 68)

Prophet Salih 'alaihis-salam said:

**يَـٰقَوۡمِ لَقَدۡ أَبۡلَغۡتُكُمۡ رِسَالَةَ رَبِّى وَنَصَحۡتُ لَكُمۡ**

_"O my people, I have conveyed to you the message of my Lord and advised you sincerely."_ (Q.S Al-A'raf: 79)

Our noble Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, once said to his companions during the largest gathering, the Hajj:

**وَأَنْتُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ عَنِّي فَمَا أَنْتُمْ قَائِلُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ أَنَّكَ قَدْ بَلَّغْتَ وَأَدَّيْتَ وَنَصَحْتَ**

_"And you will be asked about me, so what will you say?" They replied, "We bear witness that you have conveyed the message, fulfilled your trust, and advised us sincerely."_ [3]

### Follow the Path of the Prophets in Giving Advice

Prophet Muhammad PBUH, conveyed knowledge and advised their communities. Therefore, anyone who turns away from advising Muslims and follows their desires is not following the path of the Prophets. Allah Ta'ala has said:

**أُوْلَـٰٓٮِٕكَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ‌ۖ فَبِهُدَٮٰهُمُ ٱقۡتَدِهۡ‌ۗ**

_"Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance."_ (Q.S Al-An'am: 90)

Indeed, those who neglect to give advice are betraying their trust. As narrated by Abu Huraira, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said:

**المُسْتَشَارُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ**

_"Indeed, the one whose advice is sought is in a position of trust."_ [4]

Those who deceive and refuse to give advice are betraying their trust. They do not fulfill the rights of Islam towards their brothers, nor do they uphold the Prophet's advice to the ummah. As narrated by Abu Huraira, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said:

**حَقُّ المَسْلِمِ عَلَى المَسْلِمِ سِتٌّ -ذَكَرَ مِنْهَا- وَإِذَا اسْتَنْصَحَكَ فَانْصَحْ لَهُ**

_"The rights of a Muslim over another Muslim are six - among them - if he seeks your advice, then advise him."_ [5]

### Statements of the Companions and Scholars Regarding Advice

Ali bin Abi Talib, radiyallahu 'anhu, said:

**لاَ تَعْمَلْ بِالْخَدِيْعَةِ فَإِنَّهَا خُلْقُ اللِئَامِ، وَامْحَضْ أَخَاكَ النَّصِيْحَةَ حَسَنَةً كَانَتْ أَوْ قَبِيْحَةً وَزُلْ مَعَهُ حَيْثُ زَالَ**

_"Do not engage in deceit, for it is a vile trait. And give sincere advice to your brother, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. And remain loyal to him no matter his circumstances."_ [6]

Ibn Hibban, may Allah have mercy on him, said:

**الوَاجِبُ عَلَى العَاقِلِ لُزُوْم النَّصِيْحَةِ لِلْمُسْلِمِيْنَ كَافَّةً وَتَرْك الخِيَانَةِ لَهُمْ بِالإِضْمَارِ وَالقَوْلِ وَالفِعْلِ**

_"It is obligatory for a wise person to always advise Muslims collectively and not betray them in thought, speech, or action."_ [7]

Al-Mawardi, may Allah have mercy on him, said:

**إِنَّ مَنْ قَالَ مَا لَا يَفْعَل فَقَدْ مَكَرَ، وَمَنْ أَمَرَ بِمَا لَا يَأْتَمرُ فَقَدْ خَدَعَ، وَمَنْ أَسَرَّ غَيْرَ مَا يُظْهِر فَقْدَ نَافَقَ**

_"Indeed, whoever says what they do not do has deceived. Whoever commands what they themselves do not follow has tricked. And whoever hides something different from what they show has acted hypocritically."_ [8]

This is the conclusion of what was written by Shaykh Ibrahim bin Amir ar-Ruhaily, may Allah protect him. He then concludes his treatise with a supplication:

**أسأل الله بمنه وكرمه، وبما هدى إليه من تسطير هذه الأوراق، أن يجعلها خالصة لوجهه الكريم، وأن ينفع بها المسلمين، وأن يجعلني وإخواني المسلمين من العاملين بالعلم الناصحين للخلق، وأن لا يكلنا إلى أنفسنا طرفة عين ولا أقل من ذلك، وأن يحيينا على الإسلام والسنة وأن يميتنا على ذلك، غير مغيرين ولا مبدلين، إن ربي لسميع الدعاء لطيف لما يشاء.**

_"I ask Allah by His grace and mercy, and by what He has guided me to write these pages, to make them sincerely for His noble face, and to benefit Muslims with them. And to make me and my Muslim brothers among those who act upon knowledge, sincerely advising creation. And to not leave us to ourselves for the blink of an eye or less. And to let us live upon Islam and the Sunnah and die upon that, without changing or altering. Indeed, my Lord is All-Hearing of supplications and Kind in His decrees."_

May this treatise be beneficial for the Muslims. Wallahul Muwaffiq.
