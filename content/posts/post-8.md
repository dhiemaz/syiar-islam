#### Allah Brings Patience During Calamities

Some may ask, "Doesn’t help often not come at the same time as trials and tests?" The answer lies in the continuation of the above hadith,

_"And indeed, patience comes from Allah in proportion to the level of calamity."_

Indeed, it is possible that a test and problem came a year ago, and until now there is no solution. However, during those times,
Allah sent down patience that allowed us to endure those difficult days until all the problems were truly resolved by Allah the Exalted.

The patience that Allah gives is proportional to the severity of the calamity we feel. The patience Allah gives is proportional to the pain we feel.

The patience Allah gives is proportional to the strength we need.
Patience will be given to a servant in proportion to the level of calamity. This shows that there is no reason and no room for 
pessimism, anxiety, and despair when facing trials and calamities.

There is no reason to say, "I cannot take it, I am not capable." That statement is fundamentally true, for who among us is capable, while Allah says,

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">يُرِيۡدُ اللّٰهُ اَنۡ يُّخَفِّفَ عَنۡكُمۡ​ۚ وَخُلِقَ الۡاِنۡسَانُ ضَعِيۡفًا‏ ﻿﻿</p>

_"And mankind was created weak."_ (Q.S, An-Nisa’: 28)

Human beings are indeed weak. But remember, this is not about our strength. 
This is not about our power and ability, but the patience and strength that Allah gives us to face these difficult days.

This is not about the patience that arises from within ourselves, but the patience that Allah bestows upon us. 
So, there is no reason to open the door for Satan to weaken us. Feeling weak, down, incapable, and despairing. 
Once again, it is Allah who sends down and brings that strength.

#### Do Not Open the Door to Pessimism and Despair

Once again, do not open the door for Satan during those days because Satan will always whisper pessimism and despair. 
Allah Ta'ala says about Satan,

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">اَلشَّيۡطٰنُ يَعِدُكُمُ الۡـفَقۡرَ وَيَاۡمُرُكُمۡ بِالۡفَحۡشَآءِ​ ۚ وَاللّٰهُ يَعِدُكُمۡ مَّغۡفِرَةً مِّنۡهُ وَفَضۡلًا ؕ وَاللّٰهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيۡمٌۚ  ۙۖ‏</p>

_"Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing."_ (Q.S, Al-Baqarah: 268)

Thus, all pessimism, lack of confidence, and despair come from Satan. No matter how severe the problem we face, even if it is due to our sins and disobedience,
do not despair. Hence, in the verse above, Allah Ta'ala says (which means), _"While Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing."_

This shows that even if we encounter problems due to our sins and disobedience, never despair and be pessimistic, because Allah promises us forgiveness and bounty, 
provided we sincerely repent and return to Allah Ta'ala.

_"Allah will bring about, after hardship, ease."_ (Q.S, At-Talaq: 7)
