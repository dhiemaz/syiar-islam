Allah 'Azza wa Jalla said:

وَيَزِيدُ ٱللهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱهۡتَدَوۡاْ هُدًىۗ

"And Allah will add guidance to those who have received guidance" (QS. Maryam [19]: 76)

Imam Ibnul Qayyim رحمه الله said:

> "Hidayah will bring "next guidance" as that misguidance will bring another error. Good practice will produce guidance. The more good deeds a person has, the guidance will "increase". On the other hand, bad deeds will lead to misguidance.
Because, Allah Ta'ala loves good deeds so He repays with guidance and victory. And Allah also hates bad deeds so that he repays them with "misguidance and accidents" (Tanwiirul Hawaalik I/338)

Shaykh Salih Fauzan حفظه الله said:

"There is no doubt that increasing the knowledge of deen (religion) will bring benefits to a person. So the more knowledge about the Qur'an & as-Sunnah, the more guidance will be added" (At-Ta'liiq at-Taqwiim I/297)

من ازداد علما و لم يزدد هدى لم يزدد من الله الا بعدا

"Whoever knowledge "increases", but not accompanied by increased guidance, then he will be further away from Allah"
