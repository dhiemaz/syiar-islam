There are a number of things that the Prophet Muhammad SAW liked. This matter includes practices that are carried out every day.
In _Adnan Tharsyah's Maadza Yuhibbu an Nabi Muhammad SAW wa Maadza Yukrihu_, there is a hadith that mentions the two things that the Prophet Muhammad SAW liked most. 
It was said from Hamnah bint Jahsyin that she experienced istihadhah during the time of Rasulullah SAW.

He also came to Rasulullah SAW and said, "Indeed, I experienced istihadhah with a lot of blood coming out. 
He said, "Wrap it in cotton." He said, "It still comes out a lot, like flowing water." He said,

"Wrap it in a cloth and menstruate every month in the Knowledge of Allah for six or seven days, after that take a bath (hadas). 
And, you can pray and fast for twenty-three days or twenty-four days. Do the Zuhr prayer at the end of the time and Pray the Asr prayer at the beginning of the time with one bath. 
Do the Maghrib prayer at the end of the time and the Isha prayer at the beginning with one bath. And, these are the two things that I love more." (HR Ibn Majah)

In _Syarh Syama'il An-Nabi li Abi Isa Muhammad bin Isa At-Tirmidhi_ which was written by Syaikh Abdurrazzaq bin Abdul Muhsin Al-Badr, there are also things that 
Rasulullah SAW liked most. This matter is related to good deeds.

From Abu Salih, he said, "I once asked Aisyah RA and Umm Salamah RA, 'What is the deed that Rasulullah SAW likes most?' Both answered, 'Charities that are done continuously, 
even if they are small.'" (HR At-Tirmidhi in his Jami')

Imam Bukhari narrated from Aisyah RA that the Messenger of Allah came to his house when there was a woman in the house. 
He asked, "Who is this person?" He answered, "Fulanah (while telling the person's prayer)."

He said, "You have to do something that you think you are capable of. By Allah, Allah will not get bored until you yourself are bored."

And the pious deeds that he likes most are those that are always carried out by the perpetrator continuously or continuously. 
The deeds that Rasulullah PBUH most likes are also those that Allah Ta'ala likes most, as Rasulullah PBUH once said,

أَحَبَّ الْأَعْمَالِ إِلََّّ

"Indeed, the good deeds that are most favored by Allah are those that are done continuously, 
even if they are small." (HR Muslim)

In another history, Aisyah RA was once asked about the deeds that Rasulullah SAW liked, she answered,

God willing, God willing, God willing, God willing

قَالَتْ : الدَّائم

"Good deeds that are carried out continuously." (HR Bukhari)

Aisyah RA also said,

كَانَ رَسُولُ اللهْ

"When Rasulullah SAW carried out an action, he always continued to do it continuously." (HR Muslim)
