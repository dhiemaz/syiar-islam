Adab is something that must take precedence over knowledge.

What is meant by adab?

Adab literally means implementing noble morals. In Fathul Bari, Ibn Hajar stated:


وَالْأَدَبُ اسْتِعْمَالُ مَا يُحْمَدُ قَوْلًا وَفِعْلًا وَعَبَّرَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَنْهُ بِأَنَّهُ الْأَخْذُ بِمَكَارِمِ الْأَخْلَاقِ

“_Al adab_ means implementing everything that is praised by people, whether in words or deeds. Some scholars also define adab as implementing noble morals" (Fathul Bari, 10/400).


So the overall meaning of adab is all forms of attitudes, behavior or ways of life that reflect the values of courtesy, refinement, goodness, character or morals.

To learn etiquette it takes a long time. In the study, Ustadz Budi Ashari, Lc, conveyed how important it is to have manners first and then knowledge.

Why do religious scholars prioritize studying _adab_?

As Yusuf bin Al Husain said,

God willing

"By studying _adab_, it will be easy for you to understand knowledge."

Because intelligence is meaningless if someone does not have manners (ethics). Knowledge becomes dangerous for its owner and other people because it is not decorated with morals.

In fact, perhaps we often hear,

"Knowledge without manners is like fire without firewood, and manners without knowledge is like a body without a spirit" (Adabul Imla' wal Istimla' [2], quoted from Min Washaya Al Ulama li Thalabatil Ilmi [10]).

Adab is so important that Allah SWT places it as the most important thing. Because, intelligence is meaningless if someone does not have manners.

Knowledge can be dangerous for its owner and other people because it is not accompanied by etiquette.

We also have to understand the important role of instilling manners in the process of developing good student character, because in the current era, manners and character are starting to fade with the times. 
Many students ignore how important manners and character are in the world of education.

Quoting from the book Tarbawi Hadith Anthology by Tejo Waskito, manners are very necessary in the world of education, especially for students, so that they are able to understand, 
apply and implement positive things and become good individuals. 

Ibn al-Mubarak ra. stated:

"Having adab (good manners), even a little, is more necessary for us than (having) a lot of knowledge."


From Ibn Mubarak's statement above we can conclude that having a little manners is more important and necessary than having a lot of knowledge. 
Because a person with knowledge is not necessarily civilized, but if a person has manners he is definitely knowledgeable. And the level of adab is higher than knowledge.
