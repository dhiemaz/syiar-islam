Why do we so often expect human attention, even though Allah always cares for us

Your attention & grace is what I hope for

Allah 'Azza wa Jalla said:

"And when My servants ask you about Me, then (answer), "I am near". I grant the request of a person who prays when he asks Me, then let them fulfill (All My commandments) and let them believe in Me, so that they will always be in the truth." (QS. Al Baqarah: 186).

Someone once asked the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam,

وَمَا تَزْكِيَةُ النَّفْسِ ؟

"What is meant by a clean (holy) heart?" He shallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam replied,

« أَنْ يَعْلَمَ أَنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مَعَهُ حَيْثُ كَانَ »

"(That is) a person knows that Allah 'Azza wa jalla is always with him wherever he is." (Narrated by Thabarani in Al Mu'jam Ash Shagir. This hadith was authenticated by Shaykh Al Albani in As Silsilah Ash Shohihah no. 1046)

Allah Ta'ala is always with us wherever we are.
