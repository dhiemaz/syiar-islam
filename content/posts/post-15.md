Have you ever heard of Anthony Robbins? He is the most expensive motivator in the world who has inspired millions of people. One of the tips from Anthony Robbins if we want to always maintain high spirits is to ask.

"Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers." Try it yourself and I promise it will lead to great results in your relationships! It may seem oversimplified, but in fact, it's quite the contrary. - Anthony Robbins

It means; Frequently ask yourself questions that awaken us to think. Quality questions will produce quality life!

Do you know, fourteen centuries ago this Questioning method was already applied by the Quran. Look at Surah Ar-Rahman, there is one question that is repeated up to 31 times.

فَبِأَىِّ ءَالَآءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ

"Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?"

if we can answer it with 31 different answers, then be prepared that our lives will be of a higher quality! The pleasures of age, the blessings of health, the blessings of wealth, and how many other gifts have we been enjoying, but we lie and don't admit that these blessings are gifts from Allah? So that we calmly use these favours to stay away from Allah.

The Quran really contains so many quality questions for us. One of the most memorable is the question in the Surah At-Taubah: 38,

أَرَضِيتُمْ بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ

"Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter?"

We can make this question according to the situation we are facing. Ask yourself,

Are you happy that your Ramadan ends before your sins are forgiven?

Are you happy that your Ramadan ends before your recitation is complete, your target is completed, and your intentions are being pursued?

Are you happy that your Ramadan ends before you are satisfied complaining to your Lord with all the prayers that you have been harboring all this time?

There is still time left in our Ramadan to answer this question. Start our days with quality questions, so that the day ends with quality too.
