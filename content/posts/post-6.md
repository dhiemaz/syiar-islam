In today age, there are many crises that humans have to face, monetary crisis, food crisis, fuel crisis, but there is one main thing that we skipped and we should think is the crisis of faith. The root cause of faith crisis is due to lack of spiritual nutrition and the lack of the function of monotheism in today's daily life. Most people only care about the interests of the world rather than the interests of the hereafter. So that what is realized is only worldly human characteristics, such as hedonism, fashionism, satisfaction of lust, and others.
Only a few humans can take advantage of the function and place the role of monotheism correctly and in accordance with the conditions of the current human era. In fact, if today's modern society places monotheism in its daily life, God willing, there will be a society that is peaceful, safe, and far from disgraceful traits, such as corruption, collusion, nepotism, fraud, and acts that violate the law. religion, as well as civil and criminal law of the State.

**DISCUSSION**

The Definition of Tawheed (Monotheism) is one of the most important things that must be understood, owned and adhered to by Muslims, because with monotheism a person can understand what is the meaning of the life he lives (Abduh, 1992, p. 33). In Islamic teachings the sentence of monotheism is divided into two parts which are closely related to one another, namely _Nafyu_ and _Itsbat_. The word al-Nafyu (النفي) comes from a series of letters - ف – ن and letters حرف المعتل) ي) which etymologically means to eliminate, deny or negate. 

_Al-Nafyu_ in the sentence  لَا إِلَهَ means "no God" the meaning of the sentence is to negate all kinds of God. so that on this earth there is nothing to worship, worship, believe in and obey. _Itsbat_ (stipulate) etymologycally is a source that determines, in the sense that it is always fixed and correct. _Itsbat_ in the sentence  إِلاَّ الله means "except Allah" the purpose of the sentence is to bring up an understanding of the existence of Allah as the only God in our minds after we erase all kinds of God in it (Zainudin, 1996, p. 29).

Monotheism has a big role in human life, because with monotheism humans can understand the meaning and purpose of their lives. Let's see in life in this modern era, many people live without clear goals, they work day and night just to get a lot of wealth, with that wealth they try to satisfy their lust which is never satisfied with what they have done, even though Allah has said in Quran 51:56

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْاِنْسَ اِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوْنِ</p>

which means _"I did not create the jinn and humans but only to worship Me"_. So it is clear that the true purpose of human life is to worship only Allah Ta'ala and not for anything else because all kinds of deeds that we do, starting from waking up to going back to sleep, if we intend to worship Allah, surely all of that will be a reward for us. 

By presenting some examples of the results of these observations we can say that currently our monotheistic faith is in crisis. This must be overcome through an educational concept based on the role and function of monotheism as will be stated at the end of this paper.

#### The Role and Function of Tawheed in Social Life

Tawheed occupies a central and essential position in Islam, monotheism means human commitment to Allah as the focus of all respect, gratitude, and as the only source of value in Islam.

Humans who believe in monotheism have the duty to cleanse humans from worshiping humans, animals, plants, the sun, idols, etc. to worship Allah. With monotheism, the position of humans is the same as other humans, what distinguishes humans before Allah is the level of their piety

<p dir="rtl" lang="AR">يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَـٰكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍۢ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَـٰكُمْ شُعُوبًۭا وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَىٰكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌۭ</p>

_“O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware”_ (Quran 49:13).

Human relations consists of horizontal and vertical which vertical is the relations Humans with God and horizonal is the Humans relation with others. 
Therefore monotheism also has the function of forming a society that pursues the main values and seeks to uphold the values of social justice so as to inspire humans to change the world around them in accordance with God's will. 
This will trigger humans to form a mission that aims to change the world, uphold truth and justice, realize various core values and eradicate corruption on earth. 

With this mission a just, ethical, and religious social life will be realized (Khumaidi, 2010, p. 19).
In the context of developing the society, monotheism functions to transform every individual who believes in it to become a more ideal human being in the sense of having noble qualities that free themselves from every social, political, economic and cultural shackles.
* Have a complete commitment to God. He will try his best to carry out God's messages and commands according to the level of his ability.
* Rejecting life guidelines that do not come from God.
* Be progressive by always evaluating the quality of life, customs, traditions and understanding of life.
* The purpose of his life is very clear. worship

**CONCLUSION**

From the discussion above, it can be seen that Tawheed has various functions and roles that can have a positive impact on social life, namely freeing humans from mental slavery and the worship of all creatures, protecting humans from false values that stem from lust, mad power, and mere sensual pleasures, as a frame of thought in the development of science and technology, as a foundation of faith which also guarantees the happiness and welfare of all human beings, when all of its teachings are implemented consistently, teaches Muslims to make Allah SWT their center of their intellectual consciousness. So it is clear that monotheism is closely related to social life because with monotheism humans can know the purpose of their life, namely worshiping Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala vertically, namely directly to Allah with mahdhah worship and horizontally, namely worshiping with fellow creatures of Allah with ghairu mahdhah worship.
By imprinting the sentence لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ الله in the heart, it will be known that all forms of worship except to Allah are an act of polytheism and deny His power, because He is the One who created everything in nature, both in the heavens and on earth. And if all of this can be realized in life consistently, a happy life in the world and the hereafter will be created.
