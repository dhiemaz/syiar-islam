Natural causes are related to the law of cause and effect, for example, the key to sustenance in this context includes trading, farming, and working. Religious causes, on the other hand, are determined by Sharia, explaining why something happens, even if it is not a natural cause.\n\nHere are the religious causes of sustenance found in the Qur'an:\n\n**Taqwa (Piety)**\n\nAllah Ta'ala says:\n\nوَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ\n\n_\"And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect.\"_ [1]\n\n**Tawakkul (Trust in Allah)**\n\nAllah Ta'ala says:\n\nوَمَنْ يَّتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللّٰهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهٗ\n\n_\"And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him.\"_ [2]\n\nThe Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\n\nلَوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنْتُمْ تَوَكَّلُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ حَقَّ تَوَكُّلِهِ لَرُزِقْتُمْ كَمَا تُرْزَقُ الطَّيْرُ تَغْدُو خِمَاصًا وَتَرُوحُ بِطَانًا\n\n_\"If you were to rely upon Allah with reliance due to Him, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds. They go out in the morning with empty stomachs and return in the evening with full stomachs.\"_ [3]\n\n**Salat (Prayer)**\n\nAllah Ta'ala says:\n\nوَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا ۖ لَا نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقًا ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ ۗ وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ\n\n_\"And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provide for you. And the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness.\"_ [4]\n\n**Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness)**\n\nAllah Ta'ala says:\n\nفَقُلْتُ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّاراً . يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاء عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَاراً . وَيُمْدِدْكُمْ بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ أَنْهَاراً\n\n_\"I (Prophet Noah) said (to them), 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers and give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.'\"_ [5]\n\n**Infaq (Spending in the Way of Allah)**\n\nAllah Ta'ala says:\n\nوَمَا أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ ۖ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ\n\n_\"And whatever you spend of anything [in Allah's cause], He will replace it; and He is the best of providers.\"_ [6]\n\nIn a Hadith Qudsi, Allah Ta'ala says:\n\nأَنْفِقْ يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ، أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْكَ\n\n_\"Spend (in charity), O son of Adam, and I shall spend on you.\"_ [7]\n\nIbn Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said, \"What is meant by infaq here is the spending that is recommended in religion. Like spending on the poor and spending in the cause of Allah to support the religion.\" [8]\n\n\nFootnote :\n\n[1] QS. Thalaq: 2-3.\n\n[2] QS. Thalaq: 3.\n\n[3] HR. Ahmad.

Study Every Day, Practice Every Time & Exams Are Often Sudden\n\nWhatever the test must be patient\n\nTrials of calamity give us 2 benefits; the first benefit is to abort sins and the second to increase degrees. This is what we must believe so that we can be patient.\n\nRasulullah ﷺ said;\n\n> \"Nothing happens to a believer, until the thorns stick in him, except Allah notes for him goodness and mistakes are erased\" (HR. Muslim, no. 2572).\n\nSo we must remember that the test reduces sin if a servant endures it patiently. If you are not patient, you reduce your sins, then this disaster does not reduce your sins, instead it makes a person worse off.\n\nRemember that disaster can bring pleasure and can also bring punishment. Brings favors when a servant gets closer to Allah with the disaster.\n\nIncurs doom if it makes a servant further away from Allah, it means that the disaster is a punishment and brings doom to him.\n","slug":"post-10"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Attention & grace OF ALLAH Ta'ala","date":"2024-07-12T11:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/post-11.jpg","categories":["self-reminder"],"featured":true,"draft":false},"content":"\nWhy do we so often expect human attention, even though Allah always cares for us\n\nYour attention & grace is what I hope for\n\nAllah 'Azza wa Jalla said:\n\n\"And when My servants ask you about Me, then (answer), \"I am near\".

The more good deeds a person has, the guidance will \"increase\".

They should guide them towards the paths of goodness according to the knowledge they possess and warn them of the paths of evil and discord within their capacity.\n\nA person should never be deterred from advising Muslims due to the criticisms of others. If asked about a scholar (worthy of teaching), a teacher, a student, a school, a specialty, a branch of knowledge, a book, a treatise, an article, a choice between two equally strong opinions, two scholars who should be prioritized, or the most beneficial of two lessons, they should advise and direct according to what they know to be best and most beneficial for the inquirer.\n\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said:\n\n**وَعَلَى العَالِمِ أَنْ يَنْصَحَ لِلْمُتَعَلِّمِ وَيَجْتَهِدَ فِيْ تَعْلِيْمِهِ، وَعَلَى المُتَعَلِّمِ أَنْ يَعْرِفَ حُرْمَةَ أُسْتَاذِهِ وَيَشْكُرَ إِحْسَانِهِ إِلَيْهِ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ لَا يَشْكُرُ النَّاسَ لَا يَشْكُر اللهَ**\n\n_\"A knowledgeable person should advise their students and strive to teach them. A student should recognize the status of their teacher and be grateful for their kindness. Indeed, those who do not show gratitude to people do not show gratitude to Allah.\"_ [1]\n\nIf a teacher is unsure about the correctness of an opinion, they must withhold judgment. Otherwise, they may fall into the category of those who speak about Allah without knowledge.\n\nIf a teacher directs an inquirer towards something less beneficial and advantageous, merely to gain worldly benefits, seek praise, or flatter those in positions of authority, they are not truly advising as per the path of the Prophets, 'alaihimussalam.\n\n### Statements of the Prophets Regarding Advice\n\nAs Prophet Noah 'alaihis-salam said:\n\n**أُبَلِّغُكُمۡ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ رَبِّى وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمۡ**\n\n_\"I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you sincerely.\"_ (Q.S Al-A'raf: 62)\n\nProphet Hud 'alaihis-salam said:\n\n**أُبَلِّغُكُمۡ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ رَبِّى وَأَنَا۟ لَكُمۡ نَاصِحٌ أَمِينٌ**\n\n_\"I convey to you the messages of my Lord and I am to you a trustworthy advisor.\"_ (Q.S Al-A'raf: 68)\n\nProphet Salih 'alaihis-salam said:\n\n**يَـٰقَوۡمِ لَقَدۡ أَبۡلَغۡتُكُمۡ رِسَالَةَ رَبِّى وَنَصَحۡتُ لَكُمۡ**\n\n_\"O my people, I have conveyed to you the message of my Lord and advised you sincerely.\"_ (Q.S Al-A'raf: 79)\n\nOur noble Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, once said to his companions during the largest gathering, the Hajj:\n\n**وَأَنْتُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ عَنِّي فَمَا أَنْتُمْ قَائِلُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ أَنَّكَ قَدْ بَلَّغْتَ وَأَدَّيْتَ وَنَصَحْتَ**\n\n_\"And you will be asked about me, so what will you say?\" They replied, \"We bear witness that you have conveyed the message, fulfilled your trust, and advised us sincerely.\"_ [3]\n\n### Follow the Path of the Prophets in Giving Advice\n\nProphet Muhammad PBUH, conveyed knowledge and advised their communities. Therefore, anyone who turns away from advising Muslims and follows their desires is not following the path of the Prophets. Allah Ta'ala has said:\n\n**أُوْلَـٰٓٮِٕكَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ‌ۖ فَبِهُدَٮٰهُمُ ٱقۡتَدِهۡ‌ۗ**\n\n_\"Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance.\"_ (Q.S Al-An'am: 90)\n\nIndeed, those who neglect to give advice are betraying their trust. As narrated by Abu Huraira, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said:\n\n**المُسْتَشَارُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ**\n\n_\"Indeed, the one whose advice is sought is in a position of trust.\"_ [4]\n\nThose who deceive and refuse to give advice are betraying their trust. They do not fulfill the rights of Islam towards their brothers, nor do they uphold the Prophet's advice to the ummah. As narrated by Abu Huraira, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said:\n\n**حَقُّ المَسْلِمِ عَلَى المَسْلِمِ سِتٌّ -ذَكَرَ مِنْهَا- وَإِذَا اسْتَنْصَحَكَ فَانْصَحْ لَهُ**\n\n_\"The rights of a Muslim over another Muslim are six - among them - if he seeks your advice, then advise him.\"_ [5]\n\n### Statements of the Companions and Scholars Regarding Advice\n\nAli bin Abi Talib, radiyallahu 'anhu, said:\n\n**لاَ تَعْمَلْ بِالْخَدِيْعَةِ فَإِنَّهَا خُلْقُ اللِئَامِ، وَامْحَضْ أَخَاكَ النَّصِيْحَةَ حَسَنَةً كَانَتْ أَوْ قَبِيْحَةً وَزُلْ مَعَهُ حَيْثُ زَالَ**\n\n_\"Do not engage in deceit, for it is a vile trait. And give sincere advice to your brother, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. And remain loyal to him no matter his circumstances.\"_ [6]\n\nIbn Hibban, may Allah have mercy on him, said:\n\n**الوَاجِبُ عَلَى العَاقِلِ لُزُوْم النَّصِيْحَةِ لِلْمُسْلِمِيْنَ كَافَّةً وَتَرْك الخِيَانَةِ لَهُمْ بِالإِضْمَارِ وَالقَوْلِ وَالفِعْلِ**\n\n_\"It is obligatory for a wise person to always advise Muslims collectively and not betray them in thought, speech, or action.\"_ [7]\n\nAl-Mawardi, may Allah have mercy on him, said:\n\n**إِنَّ مَنْ قَالَ مَا لَا يَفْعَل فَقَدْ مَكَرَ، وَمَنْ أَمَرَ بِمَا لَا يَأْتَمرُ فَقَدْ خَدَعَ، وَمَنْ أَسَرَّ غَيْرَ مَا يُظْهِر فَقْدَ نَافَقَ**\n\n_\"Indeed, whoever says what they do not do has deceived. Whoever commands what they themselves do not follow has tricked. And whoever hides something different from what they show has acted hypocritically.\"_ [8]\n\nThis is the conclusion of what was written by Shaykh Ibrahim bin Amir ar-Ruhaily, may Allah protect him. He then concludes his treatise with a supplication:\n\n**أسأل الله بمنه وكرمه، وبما هدى إليه من تسطير هذه الأوراق، أن يجعلها خالصة لوجهه الكريم، وأن ينفع بها المسلمين، وأن يجعلني وإخواني المسلمين من العاملين بالعلم الناصحين للخلق، وأن لا يكلنا إلى أنفسنا طرفة عين ولا أقل من ذلك، وأن يحيينا على الإسلام والسنة وأن يميتنا على ذلك، غير مغيرين ولا مبدلين، إن ربي لسميع الدعاء لطيف لما يشاء.**\n\n_\"I ask Allah by His grace and mercy, and by what He has guided me to write these pages, to make them sincerely for His noble face, and to benefit Muslims with them. And to make me and my Muslim brothers among those who act upon knowledge, sincerely advising creation. And to not leave us to ourselves for the blink of an eye or less. And to let us live upon Islam and the Sunnah and die upon that, without changing or altering. Indeed, my Lord is All-Hearing of supplications and Kind in His decrees.\"_\n\nMay this treatise be beneficial for the Muslims.

He is the most expensive motivator in the world who has inspired millions of people. One of the tips from Anthony Robbins if we want to always maintain high spirits is to ask.\n\n\"Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.\" Try it yourself and I promise it will lead to great results in your relationships! It may seem oversimplified, but in fact, it's quite the contrary. - Anthony Robbins\n\nIt means; Frequently ask yourself questions that awaken us to think. Quality questions will produce quality life!\n\nDo you know, fourteen centuries ago this Questioning method was already applied by the Quran. Look at Surah Ar-Rahman, there is one question that is repeated up to 31 times.\n\nفَبِأَىِّ ءَالَآءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ\n\n\"Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?\"\n\nif we can answer it with 31 different answers, then be prepared that our lives will be of a higher quality! The pleasures of age, the blessings of health, the blessings of wealth, and how many other gifts have we been enjoying, but we lie and don't admit that these blessings are gifts from Allah? So that we calmly use these favours to stay away from Allah.\n\nThe Quran really contains so many quality questions for us. One of the most memorable is the question in the Surah At-Taubah: 38,\n\nأَرَضِيتُمْ بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ\n\n\"Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter?\"\n\nWe can make this question according to the situation we are facing. Ask yourself,\n\nAre you happy that your Ramadan ends before your sins are forgiven?\n\nAre you happy that your Ramadan ends before your recitation is complete, your target is completed, and your intentions are being pursued?\n\nAre you happy that your Ramadan ends before you are satisfied complaining to your Lord with all the prayers that you have been harboring all this time?\n\nThere is still time left in our Ramadan to answer this question.

This obligation to seek knowledge is emphasized in both the Qur'an and Hadith. Seeking knowledge is a duty for every Muslim. According to the Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI), knowledge is defined as information about a field that is systematically organized with specific methods to explain phenomena in that field.\n\nIn Islam, knowledge is not limited to religious knowledge but also includes general knowledge such as science, culture, and technology.\n\n#### Qur'anic Verses and Hadiths on the Obligation to Seek Knowledge\n\nThe following are Qur'anic verses and hadiths on the obligation to seek knowledge as written by Bukhari Umar in his book \"Hadis Tarbawi: Education in the Perspective of Hadith.\"\n\n1. **Hadith on the Obligation to Seek Knowledge**\n\n   The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said:\n \n\n   عَنِ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ لِي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَل َّمَ تَعَلَّمُوا الْعِلْمَ\n   وَعَلِّمُوهُ النَّاسَ تَعَلَّمُوا الْفَرَائِضَ وَ عَلِّمُوْهُ النَّاسَ تَعَلَّمُوا الْقُرْآنَ وَعَلِّمُوْهُ\n   النَّاسَ فَإِنِّ ي امْرُؤٌ مَقْبُوضٌ وَالْعِلْمُ سَيُنْتَقَصُ وَتَظْهَرُ الْفِتَنُ حَتَّى يَخْتَلِفَ\n   اثْنَانِ فِي فَرِيضَةٍ لَا يَجِدَانِ أَحَداً يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمَا\n\n   Ibn Mas'ud narrated, \"The Messenger of Allah said, 'Seek knowledge and teach it to others. Learn the laws of inheritance and teach them to others. Learn the Qur'an and teach it to others. I am going to die. Knowledge will decrease and trials will increase, so much so that two people will dispute about a religious duty and will not find anyone to decide between them.'\" (Reported by Ad-Darimi, Ad-Daruquthni, and Al-Baihaqi)\n\n   The above hadith includes three commands to learn: the command to learn knowledge ('ilm), the laws of inheritance (al-fara'id), and the Qur'an.\n\n   Ibn Mas'ud believed that the knowledge referred to is the knowledge of Islamic law and all its types, the general rules of Islam as well as the rules concerning inheritance, and learning the Qur'an including memorizing it.\n\n   The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was concerned that after his death, if his community did not care about knowledge, there would be no one who understands religion, leading to confusion.\n\n   Another hadith aligns with the words of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW):\n \n\n   عَنْ حُسَيْنِ بْنِ عَلِّي قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْ هِ وَسَلَّمَ طَلَبُ\n   الْعِلْمِ فَرِيضَةٌ عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ\n\n\n   Husain bin Ali narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \"Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.\" (Reported by Baihaqi, Ath-Thabrani, Abu Ya'la, Al-Qudha'i, and Abu Nu'aim Al-Ashbahani).\n\n2. **Obligation to Seek Knowledge in the Qur'an**\n\n   When Allah commands humans to seek knowledge, He uses various words, sometimes commanding humans to read. In Surah Al-Alaq verses 1-5, Allah commands observation of the universe. In Surah Al-Mujadilah verse 11, Allah uses words of motivation.\n\n\n   Surah Al-Alaq verses 1-5:\n\n   اِقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِيْ خَلَقَۚ\n\n\n   _\"Read in the name of your Lord who created,\"_\n\n   خَلَقَ الْاِنْسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍۚ - ٢\n\n   _\"Created man from a clinging substance.\"_\n\n   اِقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الْاَكْرَمُۙ - ٣\n\n   _\"Read, and your Lord is the most Generous,\"_\n\n   الَّذِيْ عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِۙ - ٤\n\n   _\"Who taught by the pen\"_\n\n\n   عَلَّمَ الْاِنْسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْۗ - ٥\n\n\n   _\"Taught man that which he knew not.\"_\n\n   These verses highlight why knowledge is so important in human life; Allah commands that before undertaking other tasks and acts of worship, one should learn to read first.\n\n   Surah Al-Mujadilah verse 11:\n\n   يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا۟ فِى ٱلْمَجَٰلِسِ فَٱفْسَحُوا۟ يَفْسَحِ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۖ وَإِذَا قِيلَ ٱنشُزُوا۟ فَٱنشُزُوا۟ يَرْفَعِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ دَرَجَٰتٍ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ\n\n   _\"O you who have believed, when you are told, 'Space yourselves' in assemblies, then make space; Allah will make space for you. And when you are told, 'Arise,' then arise; Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.\"_\n\n#### Benefits of Seeking Knowledge\n\nThe benefits of seeking knowledge based on hadiths cited by Muhaemin in his book \"Quran Hadith\" are:\n\n1. **Reward Equivalent to Jihad**\n\n   A person who seeks knowledge will receive a reward equivalent to that of jihad in the way of Allah, as per the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW):\n\n   \n   عَنْ أَنَسِ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ص : مَنْ خَرَجَ فِي طَلَبِ الْعِلْمِ\n   كَانَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ\n   \n\n   Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said, \"Whoever goes out in search of knowledge is in the path of Allah until he returns.\" (Reported by At-Tirmidhi)\n\n2. **Multiplied Goodness**\n\n   A person who seeks knowledge gains two things: multiplied goodness and a higher status than a person who performs 100 rak'ahs of prayer.\n\n   \n   يَا أَبَا ذَر لَا نَتَعْدُ وَ فَتَعَلَّمَ آيَةً مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَكَ مِنْ أَنْ\n   تُصَلِّيَ مِائَةَ رَكْعَةٍ\n   \n\n   \"O Abu Dharr, if you go out in the morning to learn a verse from the Book of Allah, it is better for you than performing a hundred rak'ahs of prayer.\" (Reported by Ibn Majah)\n\nThis discussion clarifies that seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.","slug":"post-2"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Two Things that the Prophet Muhammad Liked Most","date":"2024-07-09T03:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/post-3-new.png","categories":["Prayers-and-Hadith"],"featured":true,"draft":false},"content":"\nThere are a number of things that the Prophet Muhammad SAW liked.

For some people, conditions have worsened and do not seem to be improving. \n\nIn such circumstances, there is a hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that should become our guide in life. \n\nThis hadith should be pondered and observed amidst difficult times, abnormal conditions, heavy situations, or times filled with trials and problems.\n\n**When Do Tests and Allah’s Help Come?**\n\nFrom Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said,\n\n_\"Indeed, assistance comes from Allah to a servant in proportion to their level of difficulty or need. And indeed, patience comes from Allah in proportion to the level of calamity.\"_\n\n(Narrated by Al-Bazzar in Al-Musnad, 15:327; Al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman, 12:337. Authenticated by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’ no. 1952)\n\nIn this hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explains that help will be sent by Allah to us according to our level of need or the crisis (problems and difficulties) we are facing.\n\nIn another narration, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said,\n\n_\"Allah the Exalted sends assistance in proportion to the level of difficulty or need, and He sends patience when faced with calamities.\"_ \n\n(Narrated by Al-Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman, 12:337)\n\nIf the problem we are facing could be converted into a number, then Allah's assistance would come at that level. If the problem we face is at 70%, then Allah will send help at 70%, not less than that. \n\nTherefore, when we encounter trials and tests, we must remember and believe that tests and help from Allah run parallel in a straight line. Trials (calamities) will not leave help behind. Allah is the One who gives us trials, just as He is the One who provides us with assistance.\n\nBut the issue is, where is our faith in this hadith? Where is our belief? Because this hadith is only for those who believe in Allah the Exalted and His Messenger (peace be upon him). This hadith is only for those who believe in their Lord.\n\nFrom Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said,\n\n_\"Allah the Exalted says: 'I am as My servant thinks of Me. If he thinks good of Me, he will have it, and if he thinks bad of Me, he will have it.'\"_ \n\n(Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad no. 9076; authenticated by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’ no. 4315)\n\nIf we believe that Allah’s help will come, then Allah will send help. And if we think badly of Allah, if we are pessimistic in facing trials, then more problems will come, and there will be no solution at all.\n\n**Asking for Help and Reliance on Allah**\n\nHelp will be sent by Allah in proportion to the level of difficulty faced by a servant. But who among us rushes towards Allah, asking for His help when facing trials? \n\nInstead, we are busy going to person A, person B, person C, and so on. We turn to all directions except towards Allah the Exalted. Who among us, when facing a problem, \n\nimmediately remembers Allah, the Lord of the worlds? Who among us, when faced with a problem, immediately performs ablution and prays because of remembering the words of Allah the Exalted,\n\n_\"Seek help with patience and prayer; indeed, it is difficult except for the humble-minded.\"_ (Q.S, Al-Baqarah: 45)\n\nUnfortunately, many of us depend more on people when facing these times. The proof is that there is no increase in our devotion in prayer, \n\nno additional units in our night prayers, and where are our tears of repentance to Allah the Exalted? Where are our pleas for forgiveness to Allah?\n\nHelp descends from Allah, the Lord of the universe. Life is full of tests, like earthquakes in our lives. This is the life of believers; trials and calamities come one after another. \n\nThis is as Allah the Exalted says,\n\n_\"Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said, \n\n'When is the help of Allah?' Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near.\"_ (Q.S, Al-Baqarah: 214)\n\nThe help of Allah is near, but we are in a hurry and do not want to be patient. We do not increase our worship but want to get out of problems immediately. \n\nThere are no tears of repentance, but we want a solution immediately. In other words, we want to succeed immediately, but we do not want to go through and tread the path of success, just as a boat does not sail on land. Allah the Exalted says,\n\n_\"So take a lesson, O people of vision.\"_ (Q.S, Al-Hashr: 2)\n\nAs an alim (scholar) advised,\n\n_\"Fear Allah, be patient, and do not be hasty.\"_\n\nRead also: **Test or Punishment?**\n\n**Allah Brings Patience During Calamities**\n\nSome may ask, \"Doesn’t help often not come at the same time as trials and tests?\" The answer lies in the continuation of the above hadith,\n\n\"And indeed, patience comes from Allah in proportion to the level of calamity.\"\n\nIndeed, it is possible that a test and problem came a year ago, and until now there is no solution. However, during those times, \n\nAllah sent down patience that allowed us to endure those difficult days until all the problems were truly resolved by Allah the Exalted. \n\nThe patience that Allah gives is proportional to the severity of the calamity we feel. The patience Allah gives is proportional to the pain we feel. \n\nThe patience Allah gives is proportional to the strength we need.\n\nPatience will be given to a servant in proportion to the level of calamity. This shows that there is no reason and no room for pessimism, anxiety, and despair when facing trials and calamities. \n\nThere is no reason to say, \"I cannot take it, I am not capable.\" That statement is fundamentally true, for who among us is capable, while Allah says,\n\n_\"And mankind was created weak.\"_ (Q.S, An-Nisa’: 28)\n\nHuman beings are indeed weak. But remember, this is not about our strength. This is not about our power and ability, but the patience and strength that Allah gives us to face these difficult days. \n\nThis is not about the patience that arises from within ourselves, but the patience that Allah bestows upon us. So, there is no reason to open the door for Satan to weaken us. Feeling weak, down, incapable, and despairing. Once again, it is Allah who sends down and brings that strength.\n\n**Do Not Open the Door to Pessimism and Despair**\n\nOnce again, do not open the door for Satan during those days because Satan will always whisper pessimism and despair. Allah the Exalted says about Satan,\n\n_\"Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\"_ (Q.S, Al-Baqarah: 268)\n\nThus, all pessimism, lack of confidence, and despair come from Satan. No matter how severe the problem we face, even if it is due to our sins and disobedience, \n\ndo not despair. Hence, in the verse above, Allah the Exalted says (which means), \"While Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\" \n\nThis shows that even if we encounter problems due to our sins and disobedience, never despair and be pessimistic, because Allah promises us forgiveness and bounty, provided we sincerely repent and return to Allah the Exalted.\n\n_\"Allah will bring about, after hardship, ease.\"_ (Q.S, At-Talaq: 7)","slug":"post-4"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Between Adab and Knowledge","date":"2024-07-09T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/post-5.png","categories":["Adab","Knowledge"],"featured":true,"draft":false},"content":"\nAdab is something that must take precedence over knowledge.\n\nWhat is meant by adab?\n\nAdab literally means implementing noble morals. In Fathul Bari, Ibn Hajar stated:\n\n\nوَالْأَدَبُ اسْتِعْمَالُ مَا يُحْمَدُ قَوْلًا وَفِعْلًا وَعَبَّرَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَنْهُ بِأَنَّهُ الْأَخْذُ بِمَكَارِمِ الْأَخْلَاقِ\n\n“_Al adab_ means implementing everything that is praised by people, whether in words or deeds. Some scholars also define adab as implementing noble morals\" (Fathul Bari, 10/400).\n\n\nSo the overall meaning of adab is all forms of attitudes, behavior or ways of life that reflect the values of courtesy, refinement, goodness, character or morals.\n\nTo learn etiquette it takes a long time. In the study, Ustadz Budi Ashari, Lc, conveyed how important it is to have manners first and then knowledge.\n\nWhy do religious scholars prioritize studying _adab_?\n\nAs Yusuf bin Al Husain said,\n\nGod willing\n\n\"By studying _adab_, it will be easy for you to understand knowledge.\"\n\nBecause intelligence is meaningless if someone does not have manners (ethics). Knowledge becomes dangerous for its owner and other people because it is not decorated with morals.\n\nIn fact, perhaps we often hear,\n\n\"Knowledge without manners is like fire without firewood, and manners without knowledge is like a body without a spirit\" (Adabul Imla' wal Istimla' [2], quoted from Min Washaya Al Ulama li Thalabatil Ilmi [10]).\n\nAdab is so important that Allah SWT places it as the most important thing. Because, intelligence is meaningless if someone does not have manners.\n\nKnowledge can be dangerous for its owner and other people because it is not accompanied by etiquette.\n\nWe also have to understand the important role of instilling manners in the process of developing good student character, because in the current era, manners and character are starting to fade with the times. \nMany students ignore how important manners and character are in the world of education.\n\nQuoting from the book Tarbawi Hadith Anthology by Tejo Waskito, manners are very necessary in the world of education, especially for students, so that they are able to understand, \napply and implement positive things and become good individuals. \n\nIbn al-Mubarak ra. stated:\n\n\"Having adab (good manners), even a little, is more necessary for us than (having) a lot of knowledge.\"\n\n\nFrom Ibn Mubarak's statement above we can conclude that having a little manners is more important and necessary than having a lot of knowledge. \nBecause a person with knowledge is not necessarily civilized, but if a person has manners he is definitely knowledgeable. And the level of adab is higher than knowledge.\n","slug":"post-5"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"The importance of tawheed (Islamic monotheism) towards societal reformation.","date":"2024-07-09T06:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/post-6.png","categories":["Aqidah"],"featured":true,"draft":false},"content":"\nIn today age, there are many crises that humans have to face, monetary crisis, food crisis, fuel crisis, but there is one main thing that we skipped and we should think is the crisis of faith. The root cause of faith crisis is due to lack of spiritual nutrition and the lack of the function of monotheism in today's daily life. Most people only care about the interests of the world rather than the interests of the hereafter. So that what is realized is only worldly human characteristics, such as hedonism, fashionism, satisfaction of lust, and others.\nOnly a few humans can take advantage of the function and place the role of monotheism correctly and in accordance with the conditions of the current human era. In fact, if today's modern society places monotheism in its daily life, God willing, there will be a society that is peaceful, safe, and far from disgraceful traits, such as corruption, collusion, nepotism, fraud, and acts that violate the law. religion, as well as civil and criminal law of the State.\n\n**DISCUSSION**\n\nThe Definition of Tawheed (Monotheism) is one of the most important things that must be understood, owned and adhered to by Muslims, because with monotheism a person can understand what is the meaning of the life he lives (Abduh, 1992, p. 33). In Islamic teachings the sentence of monotheism is divided into two parts which are closely related to one another, namely _Nafyu_ and _Itsbat_. The word al-Nafyu (النفي) comes from a series of letters - ف – ن and letters حرف المعتل) ي) which etymologically means to eliminate, deny or negate. \n\n_Al-Nafyu_ in the sentence  لَا إِلَهَ means \"no God\" the meaning of the sentence is to negate all kinds of God. so that on this earth there is nothing to worship, worship, believe in and obey. _Itsbat_ (stipulate) etymologycally is a source that determines, in the sense that it is always fixed and correct. _Itsbat_ in the sentence  إِلاَّ الله means \"except Allah\" the purpose of the sentence is to bring up an understanding of the existence of Allah as the only God in our minds after we erase all kinds of God in it (Zainudin, 1996, p. 29).\n\nMonotheism has a big role in human life, because with monotheism humans can understand the meaning and purpose of their lives. Let's see in life in this modern era, many people live without clear goals, they work day and night just to get a lot of wealth, with that wealth they try to satisfy their lust which is never satisfied with what they have done, even though Allah has said in Quran 51:56\n\nوَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْاِنْسَ اِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوْنِ\n\nwhich means \"I did not create the jinn and humans but only to worship Me\". So it is clear that the true purpose of human life is to worship only Allah Ta'ala and not for anything else because all kinds of deeds that we do, starting from waking up to going back to sleep, if we intend to worship Allah, surely all of that will be a reward for us. \n\nBy presenting some examples of the results of these observations we can say that currently our monotheistic faith is in crisis. This must be overcome through an educational concept based on the role and function of monotheism as will be stated at the end of this paper.\n\n*The Role and Function of Tawheed in Social Life*\n\nTawheed occupies a central and essential position in Islam, monotheism means human commitment to Allah as the focus of all respect, gratitude, and as the only source of value in Islam.\n\nHumans who believe in monotheism have the duty to cleanse humans from worshiping humans, animals, plants, the sun, idols, etc. to worship Allah. With monotheism, the position of humans is the same as other humans, what distinguishes humans before Allah is the level of their piety\n\nيَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَـٰكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍۢ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَـٰكُمْ شُعُوبًۭا وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَىٰكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌۭ\n\n“O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware” (Quran 49:13).\n\nHuman relations consists of horizontal and vertical which vertical is the relations Humans with God and horizonal is the Humans relation with others. \nTherefore monotheism also has the function of forming a society that pursues the main values and seeks to uphold the values of social justice so as to inspire humans to change the world around them in accordance with God's will. \nThis will trigger humans to form a mission that aims to change the world, uphold truth and justice, realize various core values and eradicate corruption on earth. \n\nWith this mission a just, ethical, and religious social life will be realized (Khumaidi, 2010, p. 19).\nIn the context of developing the society, monotheism functions to transform every individual who believes in it to become a more ideal human being in the sense of having noble qualities that free themselves from every social, political, economic and cultural shackles.\n* Have a complete commitment to God. He will try his best to carry out God's messages and commands according to the level of his ability.\n* Rejecting life guidelines that do not come from God.\n* Be progressive by always evaluating the quality of life, customs, traditions and understanding of life.\n* The purpose of his life is very clear. worship\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nFrom the discussion above, it can be seen that Tawheed has various functions and roles that can have a positive impact on social life, namely freeing humans from mental slavery and the worship of all creatures, protecting humans from false values that stem from lust, mad power, and mere sensual pleasures, as a frame of thought in the development of science and technology, as a foundation of faith which also guarantees the happiness and welfare of all human beings, when all of its teachings are implemented consistently, teaches Muslims to make Allah SWT their center of their intellectual consciousness. So it is clear that monotheism is closely related to social life because with monotheism humans can know the purpose of their life, namely worshiping Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala vertically, namely directly to Allah with mahdhah worship and horizontally, namely worshiping with fellow creatures of Allah with ghairu mahdhah worship.\nBy imprinting the sentence لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ الله in the heart, it will be known that all forms of worship except to Allah are an act of polytheism and deny His power, because He is the One who created everything in nature, both in the heavens and on earth. And if all of this can be realized in life consistently, a happy life in the world and the hereafter will be created.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n* Muhammad Abduh, Syekh; Firdaus. (1975).

Therefore, no matter how \"hard\" He seems to be in regulating \nHis shari'a, in fact it all depends on the ability of the every mankind. Because after all Allah knows better, then something will not be ordered if it exceeds the ability to carry it out.\nTruly Allah's Mercy is greater than His wrath. So even though Allah obliges or forbids something, if his servant is unable to carry it out, due to coercive circumstances, then the path of rukhsah (lightening-mercy) is his choice. \nAllah Ta’ala sends revelations and initiates decisions to protect humanity and to meet human needs in harmony with their natural inclinations (Fitrah).\n\nAllah Ta’ala said\n\n…يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلۡيُسۡرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلۡعُسۡرَ وَلِتُكۡمِلُواْ ٱلۡعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمۡ وَلَعَلَّكُمۡ تَشۡكُرُونَ\n\n“Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.” (Quran 2:185)\n\nمِّنْهُ ۚ مَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍۢ وَلَـٰكِن يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهِّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُۥ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ\n\n“It is not Allah's Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favor upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful.” (Quran 5:6)\n\n\nوَجَـٰهِدُوا۟ فِى ٱللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِۦ ۚ هُوَ ٱجْتَبَىٰكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍۢ ۚ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ۚ\n\n“Strive for ˹the cause of˺ Allah in the way He deserves, for ˹it is˺ He ˹Who˺ has chosen you, and laid upon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham.” (Quran 22:78)\n\n\nThe life of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) is a real demonstration. `Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) described the Prophet by saying\n\n“Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was given the choice of one of two matters, he would choose the easier of the two, as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful to do so, he would not approach it.” - Sahih al-Bukhari 3560\n\n**DISCUSSION**\n\n* Removal Difficult (Raf’ Al-Haraj)\n\nThe words raf' al-haraj (رفع الحرج) are tarkib idhafi which consists of two words, namely raf' (رفع) and al-haraj (الحرج). \nThe word raf' in al-Munawwir's dictionary means to eliminate  (Munawir, 1997).\nWhile the meaning of al-haraj etymologically is a narrow place with lots of trees so that humans cannot pass through it  (Abadi, 2003). It can also be interpreted narrow, misguided, forced and heavy  (Munawir, 1997).\nIn terminology al-haraj is anything that makes it difficult for one's body, soul or wealth excessively, both now and in the future (al-Bâhitsîn, 2001).\nThe meaning of al-haraj in general can also be interpreted as follows :\n\nAl-haraj means doubt, as in the Qur'an 4:65 : \n\nفَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا۟ فِىٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًۭا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا۟ تَسْلِيمًۭا\n\"So by your Lord, they (essentially) do not believe until they make you the judge of the matter they are in dispute, then they do not feel in their hearts an objection to the decision you give and they accept it completely.\"\n\nAl-haraj means narrow and heavy, as in the Qur’an 6:125 :\n\nفَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُۥ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُۥ لِلْإِسْلَـٰمِ ۖ وَمَن يُرِدْ أَن يُضِلَّهُۥ يَجْعَلْ صَدْرَهُۥ ضَيِّقًا حَرَجًۭا كَأَنَّمَا يَصَّعَّدُ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّجْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ\n\n\"Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam. But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve\"\n\nAl-haraj means barrier, as in the hadith:\n      \n“O Allah, I will actually be a hindrance (of those who persecute) the rights of two weak groups, namely; orphans and women” – Sunan Ibn Majah 3678\n\nThe conclusion in terminology is that raf ' al-haraj is eliminating everything that makes it excessively difficult for one's body, soul or property, both now and in the future. \nHowever, if the difficulty is not excessive then it should not be categorized as al-haraj.\nThe term used in Sharia for the leniency granted in this situation is “rukhsah”, which is translated as exemption, license, permit or without constraint. \nThe opposite of rukhsah is called `azeemah, translated as determination or acting on a preliminary decision.\n\nExamples of applying the difficult removal (al-Haraj)\n\n1) Al-Maradh (illness).\n\nMuslims believe in God's wisdom in the problems that people experience in life including sickness. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)  spoke of the reward one can gain by exercising patience when tested by afflictions such as illness. He says:\n      \n“There is nothing that touches a Muslim, whether tired, sick, stressed, sad, dangerous or troubled, even (thorns) that stab him, but Allah will erase some of his sins because of it.” – Al-Bukhari\n\nGiven the weaknesses that prevent a person from adhering to the rules of Sharia during illness, Islam relieves the sick of certain obligations. \nFor example:\n`Imran ibn Husain (may Allah be pleased with him) said: had piles, so I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) about the prayer. He said, \"Pray while standing and if you can't, pray while sitting and if you cannot do even that, then pray Lying on your side.\" - Sahih al-Bukhari 1117\n\n2) As-safar (Travel).\n\nTraveling is a part of human life. People travel for Hajj, `Umrah, business, family visits, recreation, and so on.\n\nAbu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:\nThe Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"Traveling is a torment because it deprives a traveller of his food, drink and sleep. So when one of you has accomplished his purpose of journey, let him return home quickly.\" – Riyad as-Salihin 984 \nWhen people are traveling, they get relief (rukhsah) in prayer in the form of reducing the quantity of work (Takhfif tanqish).\n\n3) An-Nisyan (Forgetfulness).\n\nHumans are not perfect, humans have a forgetful nature and because forgetting is a human nature, mistakes, oversights, even violations committed because of forgetting, are not recorded as a sin. \nEven though this is related to the worship of Allah Ta’ala.\nOn the authority of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said :\n\n“Verily Allah has pardoned [or been lenient with] for me my ummah: their mistakes, their forgetfulness, and that which they have been forced to do under duress.” – Hadith 39, 40 Hadith an-Nawawi\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If anyone forgets a prayer he should pray that prayer when he remembers it. There is no expiation except to pray the same.\" – Sahih al-Bukhari 597\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that The Prophet (ﷺ) said: \"Whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for it was Allah who fed him and gave him to drink.\" – al-Bukhari and Muslim\n\n6) Al-jahl (Ignorance).\n\nIf a person is ignorant of Islamic matters, he is not subject to punishment if he does not act according to Islamic teachings. \nYes, the basics of Islam should be known by all Muslims, but factors such as age, being a recent convert, or living in an area where there is no adequate Islamic learning are all taken into consideration and fall under the term ignorance.\nIf a new convert Muslim does not know that eating pork or drinking alcohol is prohibited, then he or she will not be liable for doing so until he or she is educated about such rulings.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nBased on the description of rukhshah above can concluded that Islam is a religion that is Rahmatan lil 'alamin. \nBecause Allah is always provide convenience ease for his servant in carry out his orders in any difficulties encountered. \nAll of this boils down to realizing the purposes of the Shari'a and the secrets intended by Allah in every law of His law or the other name is _maqasid al-Syariah_ (Ahmad Al-Mursi Husain Jauhar, 2009).\nThere is a _rukhshah_ for those who difficulty enforcing the law in the form of `azeemah is form of legal flexibility Islam, so that Islamic law is not a static but dynamic law, in accordance with conditions and someone's condition. \nSo that's appropriate the rule that laws can be changed with changing times, places, circumstances and intentions.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n* Holy Quran\n* Ahmad Al-Mursi Husain Jauhar, K.

Western Culture is even referred to as “Judeo-Christian” effectively dismissing any claim of the contribution to the west by Islam. \nIn science for example the Copernican Revolution, based on Copernicus’s theory was inspired by the works of Muslim Astronomers like Tusi which eventually led to the Renaissance and a complete change in how western societies functioned with a separation of Church and State.\n\nIn Psychology, Ibn Sina was the one who proposed that there was a link between mental and physical health, but once again such ideas are attributed to Freud and Jung. The list could go on but despite this Muslim contributions to science are referred to by historians as “Greco-Arabic science” or using a Greek name whenever a Muslim work or scientific theory is referenced, in order to falsely attribute the impact the Muslims had, to the Greeks. This rhetoric implies that the only role the Muslims played was translating the classical Greek works, making them accessible to the West.\n\n## Why Does The West Seek to Hide These Achievements?\n\n### Justifying Colonialism\n\nThe evolutionary process, as proposed by Darwin, was used as justification for colonizing Muslim countries. \nThe West believed that it had “evolved” and developed a culture greater than that of other countries and it was its moral duty to impose its values on Muslim countries. \nThis is still being done today, albeit not in the form of colonialism. An example is the infamous RAND report “Building Moderate Muslims Network” which advised on how to make Muslim Nations more “Progressive.”\n\n### Subjugating The Muslims\n\nIf Muslims are unaware of the great achievements of the Islamic Civilization, it would be easier to instill in them a disdain for their cultural values and convince them to adopt the new religion of the West, Liberalism. Lord Macaulay in his “Minutes on Education” during the colonization of India suggested that they should develop among Indians “a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.” Cabral (1997) explains how the colonizer was successful in creating a class among the colonized people a population that assimilated the colonizer’s mentality and looked down upon its own people. This behavior could be observed in the “reformers” of that era such as Syed Ahmed Khan in India and Rashid Rida in Egypt.\n\n### Islam, The Only Threat\n\nIslam is the only religion that opposes secular liberalism today and thus acknowledging Islamic achievements would be akin to appreciating the enemy. A survey conducted by PEWS (2008-2009) shows that the majority of Muslims want Shariah to be the official law of the land with 99% in Afghanistan and 89% in Palestine affirming Shariah as the best form of governance with other Muslim-majority countries showing similar trends. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Islam is the only idealogy that has stood firm in the face of liberalism and continues to do so despite the colonizers’ best efforts to propagate his false religion.","slug":"post-9"}]
